# PySearch
This is another practice program to help me learn python. In this program it will display a GUI that will allow you to put in a number and it will tell you how far that number is in the first 1,000,000 digits of pi.

When you first use this you will need to find the placement of the folder. You will have to go into the code and change where the program is searching. You will see a line something like this "pi = open("/home/mcarmi/Documents/Programs/PythonPrograms/PySearch/pi.txt", "r").read()". What you want to do is replace the things inside of the quotation marks to match where the program is on your computer. Make sure not to touch anything else if you dont what you are doing. Make sure to keep the quotation marks and the /pi.txt.
